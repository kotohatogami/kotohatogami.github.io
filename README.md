# Personal Website
Hi, I'm Kotoha! Thanks for checking out my website.

A little bit about me...  
I'm a third year student studying statistics with an emphasis in data science. I'm intersted in using data to identify patterns, draw insights, and most of all, make impactful decisions. I'm always open to new opportunities that challenge me and help me grow both personally and professionally.

Feel free to contact me through my email: kotohatogami@gmail.com
